# Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a low-power, rapid, and reliable voltage level 
shifter utilizing a regulated cross-coupled pull up network. The voltage level shifter will 
be designed using Verilog hardware description language and simulated using a digital 
logic simulator. The final design will be tested on a Field Programmable Gate Array 
(FPGA) development board.
# Project Requirements
The voltage level shifter must meet the following requirements:
• The voltage level shifter should be able to convert signals from one voltage level 
to another.
• The voltage level shifter should be low-power and operate at a supply voltage of 
1.8V.
• The voltage level shifter should be designed using Verilog and simulated using a 
digital logic simulator.
• The voltage level shifter should be implemented on an FPGA development board.
• The voltage level shifter should be able to handle a wide range of input signal 
frequencies.
• The voltage level shifter should provide a rapid and reliable means of converting 
a signal from one voltage level to another
