# Conclusion
This project demonstrated the design and implementation of a low-power, rapid, and reliable 
voltage level shifter utilizing a regulated cross-coupled pull up network. The voltage level shifter met 
the project requirements and was verified using a digital logic simulator and an FPGA development 
board. The performance of the voltage level shifter was evaluated based on power consumption, 
signal delay, and signal integrity, and it performed well in all metrics. This project can serve as a basis 
for future projects requiring voltage level shifting with low power consumption and high speed
