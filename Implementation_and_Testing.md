# Project Implementation
The design will be simulated using a digital logic simulator, such as ModelSim, to ensure that it 
meets the requirements. The input signal will be generated using a waveform generator and the 
output signal will be monitored using a logic analyzer.
Once the design is verified, it will be implemented on an FPGA development board. The FPGA 
development board will provide a physical interface for the input and output signals, as well as the 
power supply.
# Project Testing
The voltage level shifter will be tested for various input signal frequencies and voltage levels to 
ensure that it meets the project requirements. The input signal frequencies will range from a few Hz 
to several MHz. The voltage levels will range from 0V to 1.8V.
The performance of the voltage level shifter will be evaluated based on the following metrics:
• Power consumption
• Signal delay
• Signal integrity
Power consumption will be measured using a power analyzer. Signal delay will be measured using an 
oscilloscope. Signal integrity will be evaluated by monitoring the output signal for noise, glitches, 
and other distortions.
