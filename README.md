# Voltage Converter Using Cross‑Coupled Pull‑Up Network with Voltage Regulation
• A voltage converter using a regulated cross‑coupled pull‑up network was designed and implemented using
Verilog.
• The voltage converter is suitable for use in low‑power, high‑speed digital systems and provides an efficient
and reliable solution for voltage level shifting.
